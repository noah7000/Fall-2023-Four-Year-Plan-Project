As a: Student

I want to: request a change in the 4-year plan.

So that: I can edit the order and plan of the courses during the 4 years.

Acceptance criteria

- Do I need a platform to submit the request?
- Do I need approval from my advisor?
- If I get rejected, can I request again with an explanation of why I want to change it?
- If I get rejected, can I request to a different person?
- If I drop a course during a semester, can I add it into the plan?
