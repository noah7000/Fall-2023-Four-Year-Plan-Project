*************Four Year Plan**************
This project's goal is to be able to create four year plans for students of Bethel University.
The project will have a student create a four year plan where students will place the courses
they would like to take in the semesters they would like to take them in. It only allows students
to place courses in semesters when the courses are offered and in the future should be able to 
prevent students from choosing classes in which they do not take prerequisites for prior to the course. 
In addition to assisting students, this project will allow advisors to search up a student's four year 
plan to assist them in the advising process and will keep a track of how many students are enrolled for 
what classes to help in scheduling class times on the administrative side. This project was done to give
hands on experience with agile methodologies to the development team.
