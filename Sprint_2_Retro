Went well:
Getting work done and meeting objectives
- more concrete objectives
- better communication and collaboration
- knew what we wanted to get done
- better backlog of items to do during the sprint
- stayed on track with objectives throughout the sprint

Did not go well:
The work of some members affecting the work other members
- unknowledgable of affected systems
- Not having test enviorments so members have thier own space to work
